Know the customer! Easiest way to track your Leads on channel, campaign or even keyword basis to raise marketing efficiency.

== Description ==
In the b2b business you create leads instead of purchases on your website. A lead is a new contact who is generated by (online) marketing activities.

You have to differ between TOFU (top of the funnel) and BOFU (bottom of the funnel) leads. If you have a TOFU Lead you can also talk about unqualified leads, which means you or any other team member has to contact this person in order to find out if this lead might be business for you. If yes this lead turns into a BOFU Lead and may bring you business.
Of course you only want those qualified leads interesting for you and your company. The rest might be junk or leads not within your target group.

Sales is an exclusion process. In order to focus your marketing activities on leads which are interesting for you and your business, you need to know from which marketing campaign or keyword (when you are using adwords) those good leads are coming from.
This is where the CRM Lead Tracking plugin comes into play and is going to help you to optimize your marketing campaigns.

In combination with simple utm tracking you are able to store your leads within wordpress and add the information which lead has been generated by which channel, ad, newsletter or keyword. This will help you to identify which campaign attracts which lead.

Combined with a simple export functionality into a .csv file you are able to do further processing of your high quality leads.

**Important:** This plugin works only in combination with the **Contact Form 7** plugin, one of the most famous plugins on wordpress (5+ million installations), you can download here: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/)
